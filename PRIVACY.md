# Privacy Policy for Cleanify – FB Chat Cleaner

*Last updated: October 2025*

Thank you for using **Cleanify – FB Chat Cleaner** — a browser extension designed to help you quickly delete unwanted Facebook Messenger and Marketplace chats with ease.

Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how **Cleanify** handles user data and ensures your information stays private and secure.

---

## 1. Introduction

Cleanify (“the Extension”) is developed and maintained by [Amit Das](https://amitdas.site).
This Privacy Policy explains how Cleanify handles user data while you use the extension available on the Chrome Web Store.

By installing or using Cleanify, you agree to the practices described below.

---

## 2. Data Collection

Cleanify **does not collect, transmit, or sell any personally identifiable information (PII)**.

The extension operates entirely within your browser and **never sends your Facebook chats, login details, or browsing data** to any external servers.
All cleanup processes happen locally in your browser.

---

## 3. Data Storage

Cleanify uses the **Chrome `storage` API** to store the following information **locally on your device**:

* Basic extension settings (such as last used tab or cleanup progress)
* License verification data (for premium users, stored locally and verified securely)

No chat data or user credentials are ever stored.
All data remains **on your computer only** and is **not shared** with anyone.

---

## 4. Permissions Explanation

### a. `storage`
Used to save user preferences (such as deletion settings and cleanup progress) locally to improve usability.

### b. `tabs`
Used to identify active Messenger or Marketplace tabs and perform cleanup actions inside them.
Cleanify does **not** read your browsing history or interact with unrelated websites.

### c. `activeTab`
Used to access the currently open Facebook Messenger or Marketplace tab only when you manually initiate a cleanup process.

### d. `host_permissions`
```

https://www.facebook.com/*

```
This permission is required **solely** to enable chat cleanup within Facebook Messenger and Marketplace pages.
Cleanify does **not** access or modify other websites.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

Cleanify does **not** use analytics tools, external APIs, or third-party servers.
All features and verification processes operate locally inside your Chrome browser.

### 5.1 `identity` and `identity.email`
Cleanify uses the **Chrome Identity API** (`chrome.identity.getProfileUserInfo`) to access the user’s Chrome profile email address **only for license validation purposes**.

* The email is used **solely** to verify your subscription or license and to help restore it across devices.
* The email is **never stored permanently**, **never shared** with third parties, and **never used** for marketing or analytics.
* If no email address is available (for example, if the user is not signed into Chrome), the extension automatically generates a random unique identifier (UUID) instead.

This ensures secure license management while maintaining your privacy.

---

## 6. Data Security

Since Cleanify does not transmit or store personal information outside your device, there is **minimal risk of data exposure**.
However, we encourage all users to:

* Keep their browser up to date
* Use official Chrome Web Store versions only
* Avoid sharing sensitive information while using any extension

---

## 7. User Control

Users can delete all locally stored data anytime by:

1. Removing the Cleanify extension from Chrome; and/or  
2. Clearing browser storage via **chrome://settings/clearBrowserData**

Cleanify will never leave behind any residual data once uninstalled.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

If this Privacy Policy changes in the future, updates will be published at the same GitHub or official project URL.
We encourage users to review it periodically.
